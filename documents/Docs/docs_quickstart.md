### Accessing your API Keys

Whether you intend to use the Sahha API or SDK you'll need your API Keys - [Visit the Sahha Dashboard](https://app.sahha.ai) and navigate to the API keys page to retrieve them.

Sahha features both a Sandbox API and a Production API. When you're building, we recommend using your Sandbox API keys from your Sahha Account. When you're ready to launch your Sahha enabled features to production, use the Production API keys.
